Hi 👋 I’m Gergő Imre
==================

Backend Software Engineer
------------------------

Backend-focused software engineer with 4+ years of experience building and operating production systems.  
I primarily work with **Java (Spring Boot, Java EE)** and **Node.js (NestJS)**, focusing on backend architecture, scalability, and long-term system reliability.

I’ve worked on backend-heavy, real-world systems used in production, often taking technical ownership of features, contributing to architectural decisions, and supporting junior developers. My experience spans system design, performance optimization, and working close to infrastructure.
